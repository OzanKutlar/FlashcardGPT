### **Chapter 1: Computer System Overview**
#### **General Concepts**
1. **Q**: What are the main functions of an operating system?  
   **A**: Exploit hardware resources, provide services to users, and manage memory and I/O devices.

2. **Q**: What are the basic elements of a computer system?  
   **A**: Processor, main memory, I/O modules, and system bus.

3. **Q**: What are the types of processor registers?  
   **A**: User-visible registers and control/status registers.

4. **Q**: What is the purpose of the program counter (PC)?  
   **A**: It contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched.

#### **Instruction Cycle**
5. **Q**: What are the stages of the instruction cycle?  
   **A**: Fetch, decode, execute, and store.

6. **Q**: What is direct memory access (DMA)?  
   **A**: A method where I/O modules transfer data directly to/from memory, bypassing the processor.

#### **Interrupts**
7. **Q**: What are the classes of interrupts?  
   **A**: Program, timer, I/O, and hardware failure.

8. **Q**: How do multiple interrupts get handled?  
   **A**: Using sequential order or priorities.

### **Chapter 2: Operating System Overview**
#### **General Concepts**
9. **Q**: What is the primary objective of an operating system?  
   **A**: To provide convenience, efficiency, and adaptability.

10. **Q**: What are some key services provided by an OS?  
    **A**: Program execution, file access, error detection, and system access.

11. **Q**: What is the kernel in an operating system?  
    **A**: The portion of the OS in main memory containing the most frequently used functions.

#### **Evolution of OS**
12. **Q**: What were the characteristics of serial processing?  
    **A**: No OS, machines run manually from consoles, and included job setup and scheduling.

13. **Q**: What was the role of monitors in simple batch systems?  
    **A**: They controlled job sequencing and program execution.

#### **Memory and Process Management**
14. **Q**: What is virtual memory?  
    **A**: A system that allows programmers to use memory logically, abstracted from physical memory.

15. **Q**: What are the goals of memory management?  
    **A**: Process isolation, modular programming support, and access control.

16. **Q**: What is a process?  
    **A**: A program in execution, characterized by a thread of execution, current state, and system resources.

### **Modern OS Features**
17. **Q**: What is multithreading?  
    **A**: Dividing a process into threads that run concurrently.

18. **Q**: What is the purpose of a microkernel architecture?  
    **A**: To assign only essential functions to the kernel, such as IPC and basic scheduling.

19. **Q**: What is symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)?  
    **A**: An architecture where multiple processors share memory and can perform the same functions.

20. **Q**: What are distributed operating systems?  
    **A**: OS systems that provide the illusion of unified memory and secondary storage across multiple machines.

### **UNIX Overview**
21. **Q**: What are the main components of the UNIX OS?  
    **A**: The system kernel, shell, and utilities like the C compiler.

22. **Q**: What distinguishes the modern UNIX kernel?  
    **A**: It includes features for multitasking, multiuser support, and advanced security.
